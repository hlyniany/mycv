The user is asking me to update the README file. First, I need to read the current README.md file to see what's in it, then ask the user what specific updates they want to make, or if they have specific requirements.

Let me read the README.md file first to understand its current content.I'll read the current `README.md` file to see what's in it, then we can discuss what updates you'd like to make. What specific updates would you like me to make to the README? For example:
- Add a proper project description
- Include setup/installation instructions
- Document the files in the project (index.html, VitaliyHlynianyiZhuk2025.html)
- Add usage instructions
- Include license information
- Other specific content

Please let me know what changes you'd like to see.

The user wants me to add a proper project description to the README.md file. I need to look at what files are in the project to understand what it's about. From the workspace info, I can see:
- index.html
- VitaliyHlynianyiZhuk2025.html
- LICENSE
- README.md

This appears to be a CV/resume project based on the filenames (VitaliyHlynianyiZhuk2025.html appears to be a resume file, and there's an index.html). Let me create a proper project description for a CV project.

I should replace the current brief content with a more comprehensive project description that explains what this project is - it appears to be an online CV/portfolio website.Done! I've updated the `README.md` with a proper project description including:
- Clear project title and overview
- Feature highlights
- File descriptions
- Getting started instructions
- License reference

The README now provides a professional overview of your CV project.

The user wants me to search for how to get a GitHub hosted project URL. This is a question about GitHub Pages or how to find the URL of a GitHub-hosted project. Let me search the web for this information.

I should use the fetch_webpage tool or do a semantic search. Since this is about general GitHub knowledge, I could search the web. Let me search for information about GitHub Pages URLs.Based on the GitHub Pages documentation, here's how to get your GitHub-hosted project URL:

**For GitHub Pages sites:**
- **User/Organization site**: `https://<username>.github.io` (if your repo is named `<username>.github.io`)
- **Project site**: `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>` (for any other repository)

**To find your GitHub Pages URL:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
3. Under "Your site is live at", you'll see your public URL

Do you know your GitHub username and repository name? If so, I can add the URL to your README. Or if you can provide the actual URL, I'll add it directly.
